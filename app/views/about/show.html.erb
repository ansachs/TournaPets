    <h1>What's Up With "App Name"?</h1>
  </div>
  <p>"App Name was created to provide pet owners a creative outlet when they are feeling that urge to show off how cool and unique their pets are. Pets can compete in fun challenges and owners can track their ranking leading up to a tournament. Tournaments will take the leaders for
  the current competition period and match them in a 16 player style tournament. Challenge and tournament winners build rank as they go. Have fun!</p>
